# PyHLTV

A HLTV.org API/Scraper to get player data.
Pretty basic ngl, the parser could be useful though as has all the paths to get the desired statistics from player profiles

# Dependancies

requests
lxml

# Future Expansion

Hopefully will add features like getting articles, teams, news, etc.
Another potential feature would be a search function that you can enter a players name and it gives you the player profile data
